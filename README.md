# SlicerRediMinds

SlicerRediMinds is a custom extension developed by RediMinds for their web app https://dev.groundtruthfactory.com. This extension enables the user to load original CT scans and segmented files into Slicer using a URL, and then use the Segment Editor module to label or polish the segments of an organ. The RediMinds module, installed from the marketplace, can be used to send the segmented files to the RediMinds backend for further processing.

1. Install the RediMinds extension from the marketplace.
2. Click the button on dev.groundtruthfactory.com to open Slicer and load the original CT scan and segmented file using the URL.

4. Switch to the RediMinds module and click "Send Modified Segments to RediMinds Backend" to capture the current state of polished segmentation.
